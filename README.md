TIC TAC TOE GAME

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in Java.
This project provides a basic two-player Tic Tac Toe game where players take turns entering their moves. The game automatically detects winning conditions and announces the winner when one player aligns three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.


How to Play

Step 1 ->Run the program.
Step 2 ->Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column indices.
Step 3 ->The program validates the input and updates the board.
Step 4 ->The game ends when a player aligns three of their symbols or if the board is full (tie).


How to Run:
Copy the code into a .java file (e.g., tictactoeGame.java) inside a directory named TicTacToe_Game.

Compile the program using:

javac TicTacToe_Game/tictactoeGame.java

Run the program using:

java TicTacToe_Game.tictactoeGame


Future Improvements that I would I like to add:

[1]Add single-player mode with AI.
[2]Include a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.
[3]Add tie detection to handle cases where the board is full and no winner is determined.


Happy learning !
